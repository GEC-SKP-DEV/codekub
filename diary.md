### **Project Overview**

This project is a set of scripts that automatically configure a Linux desktop environment (likely GNOME-based) with themes, wallpapers, fonts, icons, and other customizations.

---

### **Step 1: Download and Run `boot.sh`**

The first command you mentioned is:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CodeCompasss/codekub/main/boot.sh | bash
```

* **Purpose:** Downloads `boot.sh` directly from GitHub and executes it.
* **What it does:** This script likely:

  1. Prepares the environment.
  2. Downloads other scripts (`install.sh` and additional resources).
  3. Starts the installation/configuration process.

---

### **Step 2: Run `install.sh`**

After booting, the main installation happens via `install.sh`.

* **Steps in `install.sh`:**

  1. Installs necessary tools (`gum` for interactive CLI prompts).
  2. Performs identification/setup of the system (like OS detection, dependencies check).
  3. Presents user choices:

     * Some options can be disabled (like the first choice you mentioned).
     * Installs terminal tools and desktop tools as needed.

---

### **Step 3: Configure Desktop**

Once the scripts finish installing, the system is customized:

* **Wallpaper and Theme:**

  * Default theme: `Tokyo Night`.
  * Default wallpaper: found in `theme` folder, file name: `background image`.

* **Desktop Folder:**

  * Contains important configuration files:

    * Sets desktop icons.
    * Configures dock.
    * Sets GNOME startup applications.

* **Appearance Settings (via Omkaun / Omaksu app):**

  * Font size and font family.
  * Header and other UI tweaks.
